# PyVa
A smol little custom language that im writing to learn about lexing, construction of Abstract Syntax Trees and Parsing.

### building and running it
To run this project execute `./gradlew run` (or `gradlew.bat run` if your on windows)

###### at the moment this just lexes (and constructs an AST for) imports and package declaration, but im working on more
